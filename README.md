## Learning OpenGL
Week One: 
- Surface understanding of the graphics pipeline (vertex specfication -> vertex shader -> fragment shader).
- Writing/compiling vertex and fragment shaders.
- Creating vertex array objects, vertex buffer objects, index buffer objects and uniform variables.
- GLM math library for matrix operations.
- Rendering triangles and quads.
- Created a perspective matrix to allow quad to move along z-axis and fix aspect ratio induced stretching.
- Created a rotation matrix to rotate objects around an axis.
