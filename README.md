## Learning OpenGL
Week One: 
- Got the gist of the graphics pipeline.
- Writing/compiling vertex and fragment shaders.
- Creating vertex array objects, vertex buffer objects, index buffer objects and uniform variables.
- GLM math library for matrix operations.
- Rendering triangles and quads.
- Created a perspective matrix to allow quad to move along z-axis and fix aspect ratio induced stretching.
